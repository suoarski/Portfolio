## About Me
After completing my Bachelor of Science (Physics) degree at the University of Wollongong, I have developed a strong sense of logical reasoning and gained a strong foundation for linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and how these concepts apply to the real world.

Recently (2022/11) I have completed a Masters of Complex Systems at the University of Sydney, part time course work, and part time research assistant for the School of Geosciences. My research involved developing numerical algorithms for simulating tectonic plates over the course of millions of years, which resulted in a publication in ["Nature Reviews - Earth and Environmnet"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-022-00355-z). The course work included topics such as Machine Learning, Networks Theory, Chaos, Information Theory, Statistics and System Dynamics.
