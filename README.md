# Portfolio for Kilian Liss

Hello and welcome to my github portfolio, where I showcase my past programming experience, including projects and assignments that I have been involved in.

# About Me
After completing my Bachelor of Science (Physics) degree at the University of Wollongong, I have developed a strong mathematical background and how to use it to model reality. I then completed a Masters in Complex Systems at the University of Sydney, doing part time course work, and part time research assistant at the School of Geosciences. My research involved developing numerical algorithms for simulating tectonic plates over the course of millions of years, which resulted in a publication in ["Nature Reviews - Earth and Environmnet"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-022-00355-z). The course work included topics such as Machine Learning, Networks Sciences, Criticality, Information Theory, Statistics and System Dynamics.

# Academic Transcript
Since I have only just finished my masters, I am still waiting to receive an officially certified copy of my academic transcript. Until then, I provide an uncertified copy of my academic transcript linked bellow:
