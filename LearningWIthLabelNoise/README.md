# Learning from Label Noise

Many large real world classification problems involve data sets that has mislabeled or corrupted attributes. This assignment focused on how we can develop machine learning algorithms to deal with mislabeled data sets.

Other members involved in this assignment include Alexander Mars and James Wood.
