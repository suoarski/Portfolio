# The Ico-Unet

In this assignment, I implemented an original deep learning architecture which generalizes the Unet convolutional neural network to the icosphere. In principle, the model itself should also work with any 3D polygonal mesh created by means of subdivisions, assuming the data is presented to the model appropriately.

I do acknowledge that the results would need to be improved significantly for this to be practical, but doing so would probably require much more work and effort compared to what is appropriate for just an assignment. I do however believe that completing this work could probably result in a paper, as this has been my original idea, and I have not yet seen the Unet model being generalized by GNNs.
